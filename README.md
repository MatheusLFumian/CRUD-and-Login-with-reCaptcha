# CRUD and Login with reCaptcha
This project was created to put my web development studies with PHP into practice.
My intention is to use this and other repositories as a portfolio of my work.

The system creates, reads information, updates and deletes in a simple way. Using an object created for this task, the commands to perform each one of them are simple, making the work more productive.

The front-end was developed based on an open source template. All template files are available with the project, in case you are interested in implementing some functionality.
# Note: PHP codes were written using short notation. #
